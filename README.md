# Mantissa Theme

## Precision Color Theme for VS Code 

* Includes light and dark themes
* Sleek interface design
* Minimal syntax highlighting - only 6 primary scopes are themed
  - keywords
  - constants
  - strings
  - support
  - entities
  - comments
* The accent colors are chosen to be optimally distinct

## Credit

* Optimal color selection inspired by [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/).
* Used [i want hue](https://medialab.github.io/iwanthue/) for choosing perceptually uniform colors.
* Minimal syntax inspired by [Alabaster](https://github.com/p00f/alabaster.nvim).

**Enjoy!**
